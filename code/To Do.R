## create a google drive with all of our Lota lota things :p

# 1: Explore the clean_data
#   - explore patterns of the count (what is the distribution of the count?)
#   - to find nice intervals (average count? range?)
#   - use R Graph Gallery to generate meaningful charts based on the count field
# goal - understand our count data 
# task - make histogram of count field 
#      - remove all the rows with zero count
#      - remake histogram
#      - look into making choropleth map (polygons based on a value - count) from set breaks ()
# look for different lota lota data including iNaturalist
